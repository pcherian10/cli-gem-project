# JokeGenerator

## Description
  This is a CLI gem app that scrapes the comedy central joke database (jokes.cc.com). The CLI allows the user to choose an option to tell a random joke, or secondarily, select a joke from the database via a category.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'joke_generator'
```

And then execute:

  "bundle install"  

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install joke_generator

After cloning the folder, run ruby bin/joke_generator to get started.

## Usage

Choose the first option for a random joke from the database. Choose the second option for a list of categories, which will lead to a list of joke titles. Then, choose a joke title to display the joke.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
